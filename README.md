# Enhance service mesh health and performance visibility with Consul proxy metrics

Consul proxy metrics provide you with detailed health and performance information for your service mesh applications. This includes upstream/downstream network traffic metrics, ingress/egress request details, error rates, and additional performance information that you can use to gain deep insights into your distributed applications.

In this tutorial, you will use Consul proxy metrics to enhance the health and performance monitoring of your service mesh applications. You will configure Consul to expose these metrics and visualize them in Grafana. In the process, you will learn how using Consul proxy metrics can reduce operational overhead and contribute to a more holistic view of your service mesh applications.
